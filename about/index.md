Amy Shreeve is a Rhetoric & Writing/History double major pursuing certificates in Museum Studies and Computer Science
at the University of Texas at Austin. Her expected graduation date is the Spring of 2023. This portfolio presents 
several of Amy's projects created inside and outside of the classroom. 

These projects are centered around commemorative georgraphies, Yiddish culture in the United States, and literature.
"Commemorative geographies" describes using digital methods to uncover the history of locations. Then, this history
is presented to the public that currently resides in these locations. Amy is currently researching the geography of Austin with 
Dr. Edmund Gordon at the University of Texas. This project uses ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, and antique US Census data. Amy's aspirational project 
is creating a Yiddish Letter OCR to decode cursive and script.

Outside of an academic context, Amy is very interested in Old Stone Age anthropology, modern poetry, and Yiddish. 
Austin Community College published her poems "Suburbia," "If childhood had a flavor," "Paper Dreams," and "Hubris From 35000 Feet" 
in their 2018 and 2019 Vision + Voice student compilation. ["Wanted: Waves"](https://apricitymagazine.com/portfolio/wanted-waves/) and 
["Windows..."](https://apricitymagazine.com/portfolio/windows-of-the-soul-etc-etc/) are published in UT Austin's literary magazine, 
Apricity. Amy owns every National Geographic published between 2000-2013 and many non-consecutive issues since.
